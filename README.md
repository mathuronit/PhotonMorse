# PhotonMorse
PhotonMorse project will have a webpage and a circuit, a Photon outfitted with a speaker, LED, and two switches (red and green). When the Send to Photon button is tapped on the web page, the Morse code of the text will be heard and seen on your Photon. When the SOS button is tapped, the Morse code for SOS will be heard on your Photon. When the Find My Photon button is tapped, SOS will play continuously on your Photon until you press the red to turn it off. When the green switch is pressed, the last message played will be replayed.
